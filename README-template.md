PLAN

1. Plan out the HTML

- Multiple html files?
  - Homepage (new game)
  - Game (solo or multiplayer)
- html structure

2. Build layout

- Homepage -> done
- Game -> done
- Modals -> WIP

3. Javascript
   Fundamentals

- Make sure player who starts, starts with the mark that they've chosen
- Make sure that each side has one move at a time
- Make sure that the game ends once one player gets three x's or o's in a row -> modals
- Make sure that cpu makes a random move each time it's their turn
- Implement button showing whose turn it is
- Implement reverse button
- Implement score keeping
- Implement hover effects

Other

- Implement "not allowed" hover sign for marks that have already been placed in the grid

Extras

- Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

CHALLENGES

- I can't seem to reuse the the "x" class for the logo
